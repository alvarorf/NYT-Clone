          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant
          young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
          stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
          physics.
        </p>
        <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
          that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
          made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
          evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
          violent instant.</p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform
          from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron
          out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double
          box around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
          the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as
          inflation, looked right.
        </p>

          of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

        <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
          including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
          to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the
          Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
          science and speculation.</p>
        <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
          light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an
          infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
          unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
          other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="second_title">‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>

      <div class="text_01">
        <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at
          energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
          gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves,
          which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>

        <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
          team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
        <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded
          in gravitational waves.”</p>
        <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
          that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and
          as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background
          Imaging
          of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center
          for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

          which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
          billion years ago.</p>
        <div id="theory_column01"></div>

        <div class="theory_grid">
          <p class="theory_cells"> <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way
            galaxy,
            we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
            Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells"><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast
            distance
            from one side of the universe to the other,
            and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="theory_cells"><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
            direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount
            of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled. </p>
          <p class="theory_cells" id="coffee"><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a
            similar
            coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
            Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another
            explanation.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells"><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place
            to
            place before they get cold. But if all the
            coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their
            even
            temperature.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells"><strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a
            second
            after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
            faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into
            the
            large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells"><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in
            swirls
            of polarized light in the cosmic background
            radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
            Einstein.
          </p>
          <p class="theory_cells"><strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than
            light
            and cooling to an even temperature as it expands.
            That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
            original
            pot.</p>

        <p class="text_01">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
        <p class="text_01">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a
          definite
          confirmation in his
          lifetime.</p>
        <p class="text_01">“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
        <p class="text_01">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and
          analysis.
          Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
          meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
          Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
        <p class="text_01">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac,
          who chose his words as
          carefully as
          he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
        <p class="text_01">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
          inflation, known as
          chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go
          on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s
          team, <a class="text_01_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne </a> to tell him the news.</p>

        <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>

        <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
          ordered anything,
          but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>

        <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news
          like this
          is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
        <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
          astrophysicists
          responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>

        <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as
          one of
          the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>

        <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the
          South Pole Telescope,
          pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>

        <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
          universes as the cause of genesis,
          said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
        </p>

        <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new
          results
          exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s
          Planck
          satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>

        <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>

        <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At
          least a dozen
          other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="second_title">Spirals in the Sky</h2>

      <div class="text_01">
        <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
          accidentally by Arno
          Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep,
          which has operated a
          series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal
          observing conditions.
          The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of
          Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
        <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been
          there 23 times, he said, wintering
          over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

        <p>The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns —
          the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth. Steffen Richter/Associated
          Press</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text_01">
        <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light
          waves had
          a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>

        <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves,
          squeezing space
          in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the
          microwaves,
          theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
        </p>

        <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
          microwaves.
          The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>

        <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>

        <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
          supercomputer,
          making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="second_title">A Special Time</h2>

      <div class="text_01">
        <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo
          Alto house 35 years
          ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.</p>
        <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak
          nuclear forces. But they have
          long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the
          universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>

        <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology
          of gods or brothers falling
          out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.</p>

        <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
        <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until
          it is disturbed, at which point it will
          rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself
          would become imbued with a mysterious
          latent energy.</p>

        <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe
          would blow itself up. Since it was space
          itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>

        <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
          submicroscopic speck of primordial energy
          to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>

        <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal
          cosmic history was still ahead,
          resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often
          said that there is no such thing
          as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>

        <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest
          that inflation, once started,
          is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the
          cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>

        <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper
          into the past.</p>

        <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
          everything that came before it. All
          the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>

        <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the
          team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
