            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize
             the existence of inflation, which explains how the universe 
             expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the 
             Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.Credit...Rick Friedman for The

          <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant
             young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, 
             stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics. <br>
             He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. 
             Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
             evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell 
             faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant. <br></p>
