        <p>
          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant
          young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
          stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known 
          physics. <br>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
           that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have 
           made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
           evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
            force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously 
            violent instant. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform
           from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron
            out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
             diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double 
          box around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
          the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as 
          inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with 
          telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of 
          the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
          space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being 
           wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of 
           a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence 
           of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
        </p>
        <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, 
          including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
           to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the 
           Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to 
           science and speculation.</p>
        <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
           light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an 
           infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are 
           unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
            other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
