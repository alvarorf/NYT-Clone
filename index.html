      <p class="text_01">
        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant
        young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
        stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
        physics.        
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
        that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
        made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
        evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
        force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
        violent instant.</p>
      <p class="text_01">
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform
        from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron
        out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
        diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double
        box around it.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
        the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as
        inflation, looked right.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">
        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the <a class="text_01_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYc9YmKIO8&amp;feature=youtu.be">first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
        telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of
        the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
        space-time — so-called <a class="text_01_link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being
        wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of
        a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence
        of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

      <p class="text_01">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
        including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
        to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the
        Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
        science and speculation.</p>
      <p class="text_01">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
        light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an
        infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
        unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
        other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
      
      <h2 class="second_title">‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
      <p class="text_01">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at
        energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
        gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves,
        which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
      
      <p class="text_01">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
        team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
      <p class="text_01">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded
        in gravitational waves.”</p>
      <p class="text_01">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
        that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and
        as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
      <p class="text_01">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging
        of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center
        for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

        <div class="theory_grid">      
          <p class="theory_cells"> THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy,
            we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
            Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells">NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance
            from one side of the universe to the other,
            and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells">DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
            direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount
            of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled. </p>
          <p class="theory_cells">COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
            coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
            Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another
            explanation.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to
            place before they get cold. But if all the
            coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
            temperature.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells">INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second
            after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
            faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
            large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
          <p class="theory_cells">FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls
            of polarized light in the cosmic background
            radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
          </p>
          <p class="theory_cells">EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light
            and cooling to an even temperature as it expands.
            That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original
            pot.</p>

      <p class="text_01">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
      <p class="text_01">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his
        lifetime.</p>
      <p class="text_01">“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
      <p class="text_01">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
        Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
        meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
        Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
      <p class="text_01">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as
        carefully as
        he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
      <p class="text_01">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as
        chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go
        on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s
        team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.</p>
