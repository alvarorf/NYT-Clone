        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant
        young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
        stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
        physics. <br>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
        that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
        made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
        evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
        force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
        violent instant. <br>
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform
        from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron
        out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
        diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double
        box around it.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
        the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as
        inflation, looked right.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">
        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with
        telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of
        the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
        space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
        wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of
        a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence
        of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

      <p class="text_01">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
        including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
      </p>
      <p class="text_01">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
        to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the
        Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
        science and speculation.</p>
      <p class="text_01">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
        light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an
        infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
        unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
        other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
